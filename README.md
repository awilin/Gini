# Gini
Gini coef for covid deaths per million 

Files called StatDeaGini *** make it possible to calculate the Gini index for the distribution of deaths by region / state of the country in question. In the author's opinion, a high Gini index indicates a worse management of the pandemic in a given country. The Lorentz curve is also plotted. The data for calculations are placed inside the files and if you intend to perform calculations for other data (obtained on a different date) - they should be replaced.
Data for the USA are placed in external files. If you perform calculations on your computer, they should be saved in the same folder as the main file.
